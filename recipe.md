# Jeff Tang's Recipe for Success

Do you have the problem of wanting too much out of life? Are you trying to
improve at several things at once? Do you have ever feel like there's just not
enough time in the day. Well do I have the recipe for you!

Lately, I've been the happiest I've ever been (if you haven't read my previous
blog). I would even go as far as to say I am "peak Jeff Tang." I've been
improving my health, my relationships, my spirituality, my cognition...

Today I want to lay out a few resources, exercises, and concepts for how I've
gotten here. Take it with a grain of salt - what works for me might not work
for you. But I've given this spiel 4 or 5 times so far to friends, and they
  find it not shitty. I hope you feel that way too!

# Ingredients
- Peter Thiel - _Zero to One_
- Maxwell Maltz - _Psycho-Cybernetics_
- Sean Covey, Chris McChesney, Jim Huling - _The Four Disciplines of Execution
  (4DX)_

Ain't nobody got time to read a FULL BOOK, let alone three. Thus this recipe
calls for a pinch of Thiel, a smidgeon of Psycho-Cybernetics, and a dash of
4DX.

# Concepts
- Thiel: exponential thinking + definite optimism
- Psycho-Cybernetics: wokeness + self-fulfilling prophecy
- 4DX: metrics + narrative

# Part I: Exponential Thinking + Definite Optimism You ever wanna take over the
world? You ever feel like you have so much potential you could shoot some
fireballs and hurl some boulders?

Part one is about that buzzword called "impact." Since you're reading my blog,
I'm gonna assume you also wanna change the world. Let's paint that vision.

## Exercise 1: Envision a 10x, 100x, 1000x you Imagine you, but orders of
magnitude better. I'll start.

10x Jeff Tang
- < 10% body fat
- Facebook software engineering internship
- can moon walk
- no wall handstand for 5 seconds
- man bun

Hmm... it would be pretty dope if I achieved these things.

100x Jeff Tang
- handstand/finger push-ups
- MMA trained
- lucid dreams every night
- profitable / venture backed startup
- breaking into space, AI, politics

Oooo I like where this is going. I would be a total BAMF.

1000x Jeff Tang
- gone through Navy SEAL training
- speaks Russian, Mandarin, Arabic, etc. fluently
- walks through walls
- captain of industry in space
- president of US
- egoless

Personally, I was/am too afraid to imagine myself 10000x. Imagine yourself with
limitless power and resources. Tell me you aren't a little afraid.

Whether these Power Levels are accurate estimates of you is not the point. The
point is that "exponential thinking" is not our default state of cognition. But
this creative, imagining mindset is absolutely necessary in re-imagining
yourself and constantly evolving, something I'll get to in greater detail in
Part II.

## Exercise 2: Become a Definite Optimist It was (is) a great feeling having
big goals. Initially, when I had made my exponential selves, I was super happy
about it. I was making legitimate progress towards all of them.

It then dawned on me: if I continue at this pace of improvement, I should be
able to estimate when I will finally manifest these goals.

### 10x Jeff Tang
- man bun - Sept 1
- no wall handstand for 5 seconds - July 1
- < 10% body fat - August 1
- Facebook software engineering internship - Oct 1
- can moon walk - no specific date cause just for fun

I'm not sure if there's a huge point in putting dates on the 100x, 1000x Jeff's
- they are so far away and getting there isn't... linear.

My main point here is that you can estimate the future. By doing so, you can
more easily shape it. Life is merely delta over time. And you can control the
delta. We'll get to how we can better predict and act over the future in part
III.

# Part II. Wokeness + Self-Fulfilling Prophecy

_This section is perhaps the most ambiguous and mystical because it is the most
personal, so please sit tight and let me know what is unclear. I expect this
section will have the most iterations._

If _Zero to One_ teaches us to challenge conventional thought and societal
expectations, then *Psycho-Cybernetics* is about challenging reality,
consciousness itself, and our own egos and selves.

For about a month this spring, I got super into metaphysical movies (The
Matrix, Fight Club) and childhood classics (Alice in Wonderland, Charlie and
the Chocolate Factory). Obviously, the former were about "waking up" to the
true nature of reality. We are in the Matrix, a simulation. We are brainwashed,
powerless consumers. 

The latter category of childhood movies is much lighter in mood. Girl takes a
trip into dreamland, not quite sure what is reality and what isn't. Poor boy
wins a golden ticket and is transported to a factory filled with magic.

While these movies seem different at first, I see one common theme: reality is
not as it seems. As it seems is not reality.

In addition to pondering these curious movies, I also started reflecting very
intentionally and habitually - every Sunday I would go to nearby Alamo Square,
sit in the sun, view the San Francisco skyline, and free associate into a voice
recording, while also doing a sort of prayer to the Universe on existential
matters.

"Why am I here?" ... "What is the purpose of life?" ... "What happens when I
die?" ...

I started to question the very fabric of existence. I began to wonder if life
was predetermined, or perhaps a simulation, or perhaps an illusion itself, a
tragic hallucination of my wild mind.

"Are we in the Matrix?" ... "Is this just a dream?" ... "Which of my thoughts
and beliefs are truly mine, if any?" ...

Some people dismiss these questions, but I think there is a pragmatic
justification for existential, metaphysical questions such as these: you can
test them for yourself.

Once you chill and consider the fact that life might be a simulation, that God
might be real (or fake), that society and words are made up... When you free
your mind from the assumptions and norms we have been "brainwashed" into
thinking, you change your worldview. When you change your worldview, you change
who you are.

Part II is an exercise aimed at changing your worldview, your understanding of
reality and possibility.

Wake up.

## Exercise III: Wake Up

What is actually going in your life? What is going in this world? What do you
on a day to day basis that actually makes sense, and what doesn't?

My store above was merely an illustration of how I introspected more and more
and more deeply. Through movies, through increased spiritually and reflection,
I increased my consciousness, my "wokeness."

If that stuff seems too deep or mystical, then just be pragmatic. For instance,
focus on the big 3 factors that affect us: nutrition, exercise, and sleep.

Stop eating sugar for a week, and see how it feels when you have a donut. Stop
drinking beer or smoking weed for a week, and see how your body and mind thank
you. Take a cold shower.

Play around with the dials on the inputs of your life, particularly the
physiological and biochemical ones. I'm not gonna say biohack yourself, but
biohack yourself.

Focus relentlessly on communicating to the higher power(s) of your life. Ask
your unconscious what you should do today. Every time I've asked, "Universe /
God / Supreme Unconsciousness, what should I do today?" I've never had a bad
response.

Realize that your body, brain, and spirituality are a beautiful, beautifully
connected machine. You and your body are a glorious temple, meant to be
spoiled, taken care, and appreciated like an older man who waxes and buffs his
old school car every Sunday and on holidays.

## Exercise IV: Dream After you've successfully cleared your system of most of
its toxins, you will be able to think clearly. At this point, you will refer to
the exponential goals you wrote down earlier.

You'll realize that you have made progress in those areas before, and therefore
you can do it again (Psycho-Cybernetics). You will be able to turn your
aspirations into actions.

After you wake up, you may dream.

# III. Metrics + Narrative
- big picture, daily levers
- expectations vs reality
- google sheets

Whereas Zero to One whets our appetite for unbounded success, and you get
lost in the meta-sauce with Psycho-Cybernetics, 4DX grounds us back to concrete
reality. 4DX is the meat and potatoes, the "there is no secret ingredient"
ingredient.

Zero to One helps you see a new world. Psycho-Cybernetics helps you see a new
you. 4DX helps you implement change. It is the day to day operations. It builds
the velocity and momentum that carries you to 1% improvement everyday. It's not
sexy, but it is the workhorse of how real change is executed.

And change is hard. Incredibly hard.

## Exercise 5: Find Your Levers

Earlier I said we would help determine when you could accomplish your goals.
But it's kinda hard figuring out when or how you'll accomplish something. I didn't even attempt to put dates on any of the goals beyond 10x Jeff.

The first step is to figure out what the lever is to achieving a goal. In
startup lingo, they call them "OKRs". In corporate lingo, "KPIs". In high
school, "GPA" and "SAT". If you can nail down what the single most important
metric is that drives the success of a goal, and you can exercise control over
the metric, you are golden.

For me, I knew I wanted to work as a Software Engineer at Facebook. Unanimously,
all the engineers I knew told me that one thing would help me get the job:
studying algorithms. Therefore I decided to study algorithms. Around may I
estimated I could've studied 1 hour of technical prep every weekday, and 3 hours
every weekend day.

(5 x 1) + (2 * 3) = 11 hours per week. By the time my summer classes would've
started at Stanford, I would have down 100 hours. I could probably do another
100 by the start of the school year in August.  

Well, the proof is in the pudding. Peep this Google Sheet.

Why I specifically prefer the Google Sheet over Habit Tracking Apps on your
phone is that you can make a sexy ass chart on Sheets.

Spreasheets are particualrly good because they give you the bigger picture, as
well as a narrative on how you're doing. Again, I'm assuming you're a pretty
ambitious person. Thus when you see yourself below the line you set out for
yousrsefl, you will get mad, you will get compettiive. And you'll go harder.
Conversely, if you see yourslef above the line, you'll feel so much pride.

Habit Tracking Apps
reduce the friction, but apps are also very easy to forget about. You probably
have 10 apps on your phone you haven't used in over a month.
